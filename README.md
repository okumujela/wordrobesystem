This is a simple wordrobe management tool that implements CRUD functionalities.
## Wordrobe Management System

This is a problem that was given during a pre-interview vetting. Instructions were to deliver the project front-end in vue3 and backend in Laravel 11. I didn't know both, so I just did native PHP and MySQL. Your guess is as good as mine. I didn't get the job! It was a nice challenge though.
## Project Features
- User authentication (login/registration).  
- Add, edit, and delete clothing items.  
- Categorise items (e.g., tops, bottoms, shoes).  
- Filter and search functionality.  
- Responsive and user-friendly UI.
## Installation
### Local Server Installation
